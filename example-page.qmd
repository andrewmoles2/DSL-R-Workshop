On this page, you can play around with R through this website! 

Below is an example:
```{webr-r}
name <- "Andrew"

dept <- "DSL"

paste0(name, " works at the ", dept)
```

Another example looking at some star wars data:
```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

sw_heights <- dplyr::starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(species %in% c("Droid", "Human", "Wookiee"))

sw_heights

ggplot(sw_heights, aes(x = species, y = avg_height)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```
